# HR-Analytics-Database-to-Dashboard
**HR Analytics Dashboard Project
Overview**
This project focuses on leveraging Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard for HR Analytics, specifically targeting Employee Absenteeism. It involves importing various CSV files into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create a sample database, manipulating and analyzing the data using SQL queries, and finally integrating the database into Power BI to create the dashboard.

**Key Steps:**
**Importing CSV Files into SSMS:** Imported different CSV files into SSMS to create a sample database.
**Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Utilized SQL queries (Joins, Case, and Subqueries) within SSMS to manipulate and analyze the employee database. This included analyzing lists of healthy individuals and low absenteeism employees for the Healthy Bonus Program and Wage increase for Non-Smokers.
**Creating Comprehensive Data Table:** Merged multiple tables' columns to create a new, comprehensive data table tailored for dashboard needs.
**Integration with Power BI:** Connected the database to Power BI, integrating the manipulated table to create an interactive dashboard.
